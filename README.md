# The-Android-App-Market-on-Google-Play
I work as a Data Analyst for a finance company which is closely eyeing the Android market before it launches its new app into Google Play. I have been asked to present an analysis of Google Play apps so that the team gets a comprehensive overview of different categories of apps, their ratings, and other metrics.  

This will require me to use my data manipulation and data analysis skills

My 3 step process

1. Read the apps.csv file and clean the Installs column to convert it into integer data type. Save the answer as a DataFrame apps. Going forward, I do all my analysis on the apps DataFrame.

2. Finding the number of apps in each category, the average price, and the average rating. Save the answer as a DataFrame app_category_info. Renaming the four columns as: Category, Number of apps, Average price, Average rating.

3. Finding the top 10 free FINANCE apps having the highest average sentiment score. Saving the answer as a DataFrame top_10_user_feedback. The answer should have exactly 10 rows and two columns named: App and Sentiment Score, where the average Sentiment Score is sorted from highest to lowest.
